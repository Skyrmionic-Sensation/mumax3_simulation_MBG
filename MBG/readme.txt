Mumax3 scripts to simulate exchange-dipole spin-wave dynamics in backward volume configuration in a permalloy magnonic Bragg grating (MBG) with grating period of 21.6 nm. Groove depth = 1, 2, 4 nm and duty cycle = 1/6, 1/3, 1/2 were used. Three different small signal B-fields were used:
(a) broadband excitation from 0 to 50 GHz,
(b) 28 GHz signal, and
(c) 40 GHz signal.
